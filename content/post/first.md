Found a couple of interesting things about how to do more with
[React](http://facebook.github.io/react/index.html) and [Flux](https://facebook.github.io/flux/), thought i'd share them.  
[This](https://madebymany.com/blog/beyond-the-to-do-app-writing-complex-applications-using-flux-react-js)
goes through the work flow of building an app with the aforementioned lib and
pattern and the
[other](https://medium.com/brigade-engineering/what-is-the-flux-application-architecture-b57ebca85b9e#.mse899xsa)
explains rather simply the approach to building apps with Flux.  
I like React, i find it, overall, a bit less of a hassle to understand than Ember so i will attempt to start getting more and more familiar with it in my pursuit to have a broader knowledge about both frontend and backend.   
I never was a fan of javascript, *but now i'm a ventilator.*
