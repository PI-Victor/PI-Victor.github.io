##### Professional interests

> I'm interested in Rust/Go/C++ low level applications in domains where latency
> and performance matter, such as, but not limited to: (open-source) projects
> related to containers, distributed systems, or lower-level software such as
> cgroups, virtualization, or networking stack components. I'd also be open and
> would like to work in embedded software development.

> If the job is not fully remote, I'm ok with being in the office one or two
> days a week max in the Aargau, Zurich, Luzern region.

> Although i have plenty of experience in infrastructure engineering and ops,
> i'm only open to advise and mentor others in this domain, but not work in it
> ever again. I am NOT a DevOps/Infra/Cloud engineer.

  (Python, Qt) and i'm involved with our releases by maintaining our release
  CI Pipeline.  

  From time to time i rewrite things i hate, like bazel rules.  
  I've helped update legacy provisioning tools for detectors. And created 
  services that connect our detectors to our x-ray systems for testing and 
  calibration.  

  I've had the opportunity to observe scientific experiments at Diamond Light
  Source, UK and I've attended seminars for cloud solutions for scientific
  research at Paul Scherrer Institute.
