##### Professional interests

Specializing in low-level software engineering with languages like Rust, Go,
and C++, my primary interests lie in areas requiring high performance and
minimal latency. These include, but are not limited to, containerization,
distributed systems, virtualization, and networking stack components.
Additionally, I am receptive to opportunities in embedded software
development.

##### Availability:

I am open to roles that offer a maximum of one or two days per week in an
office, preferably located in the regions of Aargau, Zurich, or Luzern.

##### Expertise:

While I possess extensive experience in infrastructure engineering and
operations, my current focus is on providing mentorship and advice in this
field rather than pursuing hands-on roles. I am specifically not seeking
positions in DevOps, Infrastructure, or Cloud Engineering.

##### Communication:

I prioritize roles that are clearly defined; as such, I will only respond to
messages from recruiters that include a comprehensive job description.

##### Technology Preferences:

I have a strong inclination for languages that prioritize performance, and I
am less enthusiastic about using languages like Java, Ruby, or PHP. I also
prefer to minimize work involving Terraform, YAML files, or CI pipelines in
Groovy.


* Remote - Part time contracting/consulting work 
* Remote - Full time opportunities if they match the `interested in`
  description above.  
*I favor opportunities that allow home office full time, even if they are on US hours*

i'm more into fast cars.

I enjoy the company of my Yorkshire Terrier above everything else.
