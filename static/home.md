##### What I'm Into
Hey there! I'm big on low-level software engineering, having a blast with
languages like Rust, Go, and C++. I'm always excited to dive into
high-performance projects—think containerization, distributed systems, and all
that good stuff. And hey, I'm not opposed to getting my hands dirty with some
embedded software development.

##### Where and When I Work Best
I'm hoping to find something where I'm in the office a day or two a week,
ideally hanging out in regions around Aargau, Zurich, or Luzern.

##### What I've Been Up To
I've spent plenty of time in infrastructure engineering and operations, but I'm
steering towards roles where I can really dive into optimizing system
performances and memory utilization. I'm ready to lend my expertise more on the
strategy side of things, moving away from the hands-on roles I've had in DevOps
and Cloud Engineering.

##### What Catches My Eye
To the recruiters out there — let's keep it straightforward and detailed with
the job descriptions. It sets the stage for a solid, productive conversation.

##### Tech Preferences
I've got a thing for efficient and powerful languages — Rust, Go, and C++ are
my go-to's right now. I'm eager to use them to whip up solutions that are both
powerful and efficient.

##### What I'm Looking For

* Remote - Part time contracting/consulting work 
* Remote - Full time opportunities if they match the `interested in`
  description above.  
*I favor opportunities that allow home office full time, even if they are on US hours*

i'm more into fast cars.

I enjoy the company of my Yorkshire Terrier above everything else.
